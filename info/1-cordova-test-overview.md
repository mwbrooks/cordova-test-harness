# Apache Cordova Test Overview

## Mobile Spec

Apache Cordova (PhoneGap) has a JavaScript test suite that tests every JavaScript
API that is implemented. Most of these APIs are based on W3C drafts and the
tests can be valuable to the Test the Web Forward project.

## Running the Tests

Simply open `index.html` in the root of the souce code project. In later articles,
we will cover the details of running the test suite.

## Jasmine.js

All of the tests are written in a behaviour-driven development testing framework
called Jasmine.

The documentation for Jasmine can be found here:
